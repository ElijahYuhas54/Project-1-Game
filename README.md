## üìñ Game Overview

**Lightbearer: Rise of the Ember** is a 2D narrative-driven action-platformer where players control a character named Kael, a rejected villager who stumbles upon an ancient ember that grants him the ability to manipulate light. The game explores themes of personal growth, community healing, and reclaiming agency in a world that has lost hope.

The gameplay loop revolves around exploring interconnected environments, solving light-based puzzles, and empowering NPCs by restoring their lost abilities or memories. As Kael grows stronger, he unlocks new light powers that allow him to traverse previously inaccessible areas, defeat shadow creatures, and inspire others to resist the darkness.

The narrative follows Kael‚Äôs journey from isolation to leadership. Each empowered NPC adds to the resistance, and their stories reveal the history of the world and the consequences of fear and division. The game ends with a collective uprising, symbolizing the power of unity and self-belief.

## üé® Mood Board Concept

**Colors**: Warm ambers, deep purples, and soft blues to contrast light vs shadow. Empowered areas glow with vibrant hues.  
**Environment Design**: Ruined villages, ancient temples, shadow-infested forests, and glowing sanctuaries. Each area reflects the emotional state of its inhabitants.  
**Character Design**: Kael wears a tattered cloak that gradually becomes radiant. NPCs have visual cues showing their emotional state (e.g., dull eyes, hunched posture) that change when empowered.  
**Narrative Visuals**: Light trails, memory fragments, and murals that tell the story of the world. Empowerment is shown through visual transformation.  
**Mood/Tone**: Hopeful, mysterious, and emotionally resonant. The tone shifts from despair to triumph as the player progresses.

## üß© Game Design Images (Concepts)

**Level Layout**: Side-scrolling platformer with vertical exploration. Puzzle rooms require light manipulation (e.g., bouncing beams, timed switches).  
**HUD Elements**: Light meter, health bar, NPC empowerment tracker.  
**Enemy Design**: Shadow creatures that react to light differently (some flee, some attack, some transform).  
**Empowerment Scenes**: NPCs regain color and stand tall after being helped. Some join Kael and offer gameplay benefits (e.g., open shortcuts, give items).  
**AI Image Note**: Any AI-generated images used will be clearly marked as "AI Image".
